## 4-bit_adder_sort.py
### Code Review for `4-bit_adder_sort.py`

#### Strengths:
1. **Clear Purpose**: The script has a well-defined purpose, which is to read a truth table for a 4-bit adder, sort it, and fill in missing combinations.
2. **Modular Functions**: The use of functions like `clean_O_prefix`, `split_tokens`, and `fill_outputs` enhances readability and maintainability.
3. **Use of Data Structures**: The use of sets for tracking seen inputs is efficient and appropriate for the task.
4. **Comprehensive Handling of Missing Inputs**: The script effectively identifies and fills in missing input combinations, ensuring completeness of the truth table.
5. **Sorting Mechanism**: The sorting of unique rows based on binary keys is a logical approach to ensure the output is in the correct order.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Error Handling**: The `fill_outputs` function uses a broad `except` clause, which can mask unexpected errors. It would be better to catch specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`) to avoid silent failures.
2. **Magic Numbers**: The use of `512` in `all_possible_inputs` is a magic number that could be replaced with a constant or derived from the number of bits.
3. **Assumption of Input Format**: The script assumes a specific format for the input file without validation. If the input format changes, the script may fail without clear feedback.
4. **Inefficient Row Processing**: The current approach processes each row multiple times (cleaning, filtering, and filling outputs), which could be optimized.
5. **Lack of Documentation**: While the initial comment provides some context, inline comments explaining complex logic, especially in the `fill_outputs` function, would enhance understanding for future maintainers.

#### Suggestions:
1. **Improve Error Handling**: Modify the `fill_outputs` function to catch specific exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
   ```python
   except ValueError as e:
       print(f"Error processing row {row}: {e}")
       return row
   ```
   
2. **Define Constants**: Replace magic numbers with constants for better readability and maintainability.
   ```python
   NUM_BITS = 9
   all_possible_inputs = set(format(i, f'0{NUM_BITS}b') for i in range(2**NUM_BITS))
   ```

3. **Input Validation**: Add validation to check the format of the input file and ensure it meets expectations before processing.
   ```python
   if len(header_tokens) < len(desired_header):
       raise ValueError("Input file does not contain the expected number of columns.")
   ```

4. **Optimize Row Processing**: Consider processing each row only once, combining the cleaning and output filling into a single pass.
5. **Enhance Documentation**: Add more inline comments and possibly a docstring for each function to explain its purpose and parameters.

By addressing these issues and implementing the suggestions, the code can become more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand for future developers.

## Truth_table_verification.py
### Code Review for `Truth_table_verification.py`

#### Strengths:
1. **Clarity of Purpose**: The script clearly states its purpose in the comment at the top, which is to verify the truth table for a 4-bit adder.
2. **Use of CSV Module**: The use of the `csv` module for reading the truth table is appropriate and efficient.
3. **Error Handling**: The implementation includes error handling to catch exceptions during processing, which helps in identifying problematic rows.
4. **Bit Manipulation**: The use of bitwise operations to calculate the sum and extract bits is efficient and demonstrates a good understanding of binary arithmetic.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Hardcoded File Name**: The CSV file name is hardcoded, which limits flexibility. If the file name changes or if the script needs to be reused with different files, modifications will be necessary.
2. **Lack of Input Validation**: There is no validation to ensure that the input values are indeed binary (0 or 1). If the CSV contains invalid data, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. **General Exception Handling**: The use of a broad `Exception` catch can obscure the specific errors that occur. It would be better to catch specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`) to provide clearer feedback.
4. **Output Formatting**: The output messages are in Korean, which may not be accessible to all users. Consider adding an option for English output or making it configurable.
5. **Performance**: The script reads all rows into memory at once (`all_rows = list(reader)`), which could be problematic for very large CSV files. It may be more efficient to process rows one at a time.

#### Suggestions:
1. **Parameterize File Name**: Consider allowing the file name to be passed as a command-line argument or as a function parameter to improve flexibility.
   ```python
   import sys
   csv_file = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 'output_truth_table_fixed.csv'
   ```
   
2. **Input Validation**: Implement input validation to ensure that the values read from the CSV are either 0 or 1. This can prevent unexpected errors during processing.
   ```python
   if row[f'A{i}'] not in ['0', '1'] or row[f'B{i}'] not in ['0', '1']:
       raise ValueError("Input values must be binary (0 or 1).")
   ```

3. **Specific Exception Handling**: Catch specific exceptions to provide more informative error messages.
   ```python
   except ValueError as ve:
       errors.append({'row': row, 'error': str(ve)})
   ```

4. **Consider Using a Logger**: Instead of printing errors directly, consider using the `logging` module for better control over logging levels and output formats.

5. **Iterate Through Rows**: Instead of loading all rows into memory, consider processing each row as it is read. This can be done using a loop directly on the `reader`.
   ```python
   for row in reader:
       # processing logic
   ```

6. **Internationalization**: If the script is intended for a broader audience, consider implementing internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages.

By addressing these points, the script can be made more robust, flexible, and user-friendly.
